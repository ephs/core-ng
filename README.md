# Core-ng: A functioning core rewrite written in Angular 6.
---
Complete redesign of CORE (A web app program at my high school). 

Interacts with [Core API](https://github.com/ephs/coreAPI). Make sure you adjust the *config.service.ts* file in *src/app/core* to point to the API server.

## Setup
---
Have `npm` (node.js) and Angular (`npm install -g @angular/cli`) installed then, in the repository:

`npm install && ng serve`

to get a dev enviornment up and running. 

You can build an Angular app using the `ng build --prod` command. There are some .zip's in the releases tab.
